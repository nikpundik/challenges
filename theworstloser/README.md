# The Worst Loser: Instruction Manual

## Objective:

The goal of the game is to avoid being the last remaining player in the Losers Pool, as this player is deemed the "Worst Loser."

## Setup:

- **Players**: 4 to N players
- **Losers Pool**: Initially includes all players.

## Game Flow:

### Rounds:

- The game consists of multiple rounds, continuing until only one player remains in the Losers Pool.

### Topic Selection:

- At the beginning of each round, pick a random topic. Examples include "barbecue," "house cleaning," etc.

### Submission Phase:

- Each player chooses the "worst loser" for the given topic from the Losers Pool and writes down the reason.
- Example: "Matt is a loser at barbecuing because he could eat everything before others arrive to the party."

### Voting Phase:

- All submissions are read aloud (anonymously).
- Each player votes on which submission (i.e., which proposed loser and reason) they think is the worst.

### Results Phase:

- The player with the fewest votes is removed from the Losers Pool.
- If there is a tie (more than one player receives the fewest votes), the "worst loser" of the round decides who is the least loser and removes them from the Losers Pool.

### Continuation:

- Continue with new topics and rounds, selecting from the remaining players in the Losers Pool.
- Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each round.

## Endgame:

- The game continues until only one player remains in the Losers Pool.
- The last remaining player in the Losers Pool is declared the "Worst Loser."
