    "body": "\nEDIT: As I finally managed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ https://youtu.be/nD_NDngrEl8 to get my hands on the handle \"@nicogs\" I have had some trouble with creating issues. Only through the github app on my phone, issues were created without errors. \n\nApparently the transition from my old handle is done, might have created 2 separate issues. \n\n--\n\nChaos Theory is the idea that tiny changes in initial conditions will escalate into much bigger differences in the future.\n\nThe first part of my submission showcases this theory displaying several double pendulums with very small differences in length, mass or both.\n[ðŸ‘‰ Chaos](https://nicogs.github.io/chaosChallange/chaos.html)\n\nAnother variable that defines a double pendulum are the angels made by both pendulums. While the mass and length of the pendulums will stay the same over time, the angles will evolve over time and rarely stay constant.\n\nIn the second part of my submission I explore the change of initial angles and how they evolve over time. On one axis weâ€™ll change the first angle and in the second the second angle. Notice how the initial harmony turns into chaos towards the edges while the centre stays harmonious for a longer time. \n[ðŸ‘‰ Matrix](https://nicogs.github.io/chaosChallange/matrix.html)\n\nNow we could visualise how these angles evolve, building upon the matrix of the previous part by giving each cell a color. Now both angles are mapped to an rgb value. \n\nThis is how we get to the third part of this submission. The double pendulum fractal. Where every pixel is coloured based on the angles of a double pendulum.\n[ðŸ‘‰ Fractal](https://nicogs.github.io/chaosChallange/fractal.html)\n",
